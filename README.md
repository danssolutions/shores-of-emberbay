## What this project is all about

'Shores of Emberbay' follows the player character, who, after being named the mayor of a run-down coastal village, is tasked with restoring the settlement to its former state of prosperity in a period of 12 months. The game investigates how pollution and unsustainable fishing impact the long-term well-being of the people and what actions can be taken to overcome these problems locally. The mayor interacts with different character who give them tasks to complete, in order to improve the village population's health. Progress is achieved by allocating villagers to different locations to fish or clean the water reservoirs. Along the way, the player character can unlock some new locations and tools which will help them reach their goal. At the end of the in-game year, the mayor's accomplishments are evaluated and determine the fate of the settlement which results in one of 3 endings.
